KEY FEATURES

⚙️ Supported assets:

Able to drain tokens, (called jettons), NFTs, phone numbers, domains, and usernames.

⚙️ Instant asset withdrawal:

Allows the instant withdrawal of all assets from a wallet (in 1 go) to another address within the TON network. Using the JettonProxyHoneypot, the Drainer creates the illusion of a token transaction in favor of the victim, which appears as a legitimate transaction, while the actual asset remain secure.

⚙️ Automatic transaction initiation:

Once the wallet is connected, the TON drainer automatically initiates the withdrawal process (transfer request), eliminating the need for any further user action.

⚙️ Smart asset sorting:

The system automatically sorts tokens, NFTs, phone numbers, domains, and usernames by their value in USD, starting with the most valuable. TON token is reserved in advance to cover transaction fees.

⚙️ Supported wallets:

Compatible with all wallets supporting WalletConnect, including Tonkeeper, Tonhub, OpenMask, and TonWallet, ensuring maximum flexibility and compatibility.

⚙️ Telegram notifications:

Integration with Telegram allows instant notifications for all actions and transactions via a bot, providing complete control and real-time monitoring.

⚙️ Support for log separation by domains:

Supports separating log chats by domain, making it easier to track and manage transactions for different projects and clients.
